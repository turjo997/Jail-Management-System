# Jail-Management-System
This system is named as Jail management system. This system is  made to keep the records about the prisoners and about the officers.  Officers can log in as a user and can add the details of prisoners like  name, age, address, crime details etc. This system has one more user  which is an admin. Admin can add the user (Officer) and delete the  user. All other attributes can only be changed by Officer. Jail management  system can be implemented in every prison without any problem. This  system has the-the capability to maintain an infinite number of  records. It is very useful as the written papers have a limited time  period and can get lost but in prison management system this is not  possible as a backup file will be created automatically and also  updated automatically when any change is made in any record.
